My Name is `Daniel Krätschmer`, Simulation Expert and Data Enthusiast working for Robert Bosch GmbH in several Engineering positions since 2011. In my current position as `Senior Manager for Digitalization in Engineering` I am serving Bosch setting up our Digitalization Journey in the Engineeering. I am supporting our Bosch Developers for Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and mechatronical systems by:
- **Processes**: Business Process Digitalization Support
- **Organiation**: Organization Development towards Agile
- **Data**: Data and Information Management 
- **Algorithms**: Software Development for several Engineering disciplines
- **Operations**: CAD/PLM Hosting (ptc Windchill & CREO) & Operations 
- **Services**: Development Environments (IDEs) for both Software Developers and Mechanical Engineers

## Background

In 2001 I started with the [`Technology Management`](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/studium/bachelor/technologiemanagement-b.sc./) diploma course at [`University of Stuttgart`](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de) deep diving into the disciplines necessary for mechanical engineering and business administration success.  
During my studies I combined Engineering competencies of `Thermal Turbomachinery` as well as `Material Science & Strength of Materials` to master numerical simulation methods for both fluids and structures.

After my diploma thesis written at DaimlerChrysler and graduation I continued my studies and research at [`Materialprüfungsanstalt (MPA) Universität Stuttgart`](https://www.mpa.uni-stuttgart.de) focusing on developing complex nonlinear Material Models for e.g., fatigue, damage and fracture mechanics. 
In 2009 I took over the responsibility of MPA's welding lab optimizing spot welding and friction stir welding processes by combined tests and simulation.

In 2011 I obtained a Doctorate Degree (Dr.-Ing.) from the Faculty of Energy-, Process- and Bio-Engieering at Stuttgart University, comparable to an international Ph.D. degree. 
In my thesis [`Evaluation of microstructural fatigue damage with stochastic methods`](http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-1923) I analyzed microstructural fatigue of aluminum piston alloys, e.g., AlSi12Cu4MgNi2 and redesigned and extended an existing approach for austenitic steels to calculate damage and remaining lifetime in applying stochastic models based on Markov Chains. Here just an excerpt image of the thesis to illustrate considered microstructure in numerical simulation with constitutive material laws:
